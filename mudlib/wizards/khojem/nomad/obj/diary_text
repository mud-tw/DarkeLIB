Activity log of Raol de'Acruut, 
Captain, First Nomadic Irregulars


Biggus 2, Darkeday: Our troop, accompanied by Chief Moped,
Wizard Khojem, and the tribe, arrive after a two day march
from Vo'Sangor to an oasis in the Wastelands of Bir'Barrutt.
Khojem advised Chief Moped to make camp here.  Naturally, 
that lizard of a chief followed his advise!

Biggus 3, Grayday:
Wizard Khojem, that spawn of a one-humped camel!, conjured 
up a feast for the entire tribe and had his way with the 
best of Chief Moped's harem.  After a late morning council
with the chief, ventured off into the Wastelands.  Our camp
is established, water supply is fair, the chief's guards 
are posted around the camp, and I have sent scouts into the 
wastelands to ward off approachers.

Biggus 4, Stoneday:
Camp is well established now.  On Chief Moped's orders,
I dispatched a war-party to reconnoiter the nearby well
and report on its feasibility as a permanent water supply.
It seems the chief wishes to establish a permanent camp here.
Scouts report back late today of a wandering lone high-man
warrior, Nutnux, searching the wastelands for a sash of some 
sort.  He was reported as non-hostile, if not provoked, and a 
satanic fighter when attacked.  The scout, Azed, reported a 
magical, sleeping sand creature who when woken killed three 
of the four-man scout team in combat.  Azed, the survivor 
was badly wounded.  I ordered all scouts to avoid the area.
When the war-party returns I will order them to return me 
the head of this sand creature!

Biggus 5, Skullday:
The scout, Azed, now partially healed from his wounds by 
the tribal cleric, departed the camp as a berserk,mad man.
The guards reported he swore death an all those traveling
the wastelands.  Since he is unwed, I decided not to send
out warriors for his return.  The war-party dispatched  to 
reconnoiter the well has not reported.  I sent a team of 
scouts to investigate.

Biggus 5, Skullday(addendum):
I was awakened to an urget report from the survivors of the 
scouts investigating the where-abouts of our missing war-party.
They reported the war-party was destroyed by a hideous foe.
Their slain bodies were seen spiked and trussed to the walls
within the well!  Their bodies mutilated and striped naked!
I called an urgent council with Chief Moped.  He conveyed 
that Wizard Khojem had suspected a great, evil force layed 
in waiting within the well.  Chief Moped instructed me to 
prepare my warriors for battle at morning's first light.

Biggus 6, Blackday: 
Chief Moped has ordered the First Nomadic Irregulars to
attack the creatures of the well.  His personal guard will
remain and defend the encampment.  I suspect the chief is
a coward.  I will personally lead my men in battle.  It will
be glorious!  My men have not fought recently and a good 
battle shall hone them into veterans.  I must close this 
entry now and prepare my troop for battle.  We march to
the well soon.

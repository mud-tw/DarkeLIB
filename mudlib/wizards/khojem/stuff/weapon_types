# This is the file that contains all weapons forgeable (is that a word)
# by tinkers.  It is set up in the following fashion:
#
# the beginning of a weapon section has the following format:
#
# (weapon-name):
#
# on a line by itself. weapon-name may contain NO SPACES.
#
# Then proceed to code it as if it were a normal weapon.
# Use the format:
# <what you want to set>:::
# arg;arg;arg;etc.
# 
# <what you want to set> is anything you would set in the weapon.
# i.e., wc for set_wc, short for set_short, etc.
# So, if you were coding a weapon and you would normally say:
#	set_wc(20, "cutting");
# You would say here:
# wc:::
# 20;"cutting"
#
# The args need not be on the same line; they may even take up more than one
# line themselves as long as each arg is separated by a semicolon

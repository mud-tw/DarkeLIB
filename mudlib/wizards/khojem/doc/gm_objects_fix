Subject: GM's without powerz

It has come to my attention that some GM's lose their powers
sopradically, presumably due to the loss of the GM sobject
due to a crash or something.  To restore this GM, do this:
1. call the reset_master function in the join room of the guild.
2. Have the GM re-wield or re-wear the equipment of the GM, or
re-clone it if he/she doesnt have it.
3. That should do it.

Items with special weapons class (example:  set_wc(8,"fire")) need
some special considerations if coded.  Weapons of this grade detract
from other guild capabilities and its use should be limited.  Also,
you need to code properties associated with that weapon's class into
the object code.  For example:

//  Wizard:  Khojem 
//  Newbie Wizard Skewer

inherit "/std/weapon";

create() { 
  int   idx; 
  mixed ench_str; 
  ::create(); 
set_name("skewer");
set_ac(8); 
set("id", ({ "spear", "skewer" })); 
set("short", "Khojem's Great Newbie-Wizard Skewer"); 
set("long", "This is used to impale wizards who gen "+
  "big weapons in their areas."); 
set_type("two handed polearm"); 
set_quality(6); 
et_wc(28, "impaling");

// set enchantment - *glow* in short description
set_property("enchantment",4);

// maximum spell stacking for flame blade is 4 
// see /std/spells/flame_blade.c  
set_property("flame blade", 4);

// wc = (power+2) * stack  so, (6 +2) *2 = 32
set_wc(32,"fire");

// allows enchanter w/ detect magic skill to determine
// magic and power of magic on LOOK AT SKEWER
ench_str = ({ ({ "This weapon has %^ORANGE%^Flame Blade%^RESET%^.",
  "detect magic" }) });
set_property("extra long",ench_str);

set_verb("spear");
set_parry_bonus(-10);
set_weight(95);
set_value(120); 
}


Now, when the player does an inventory he/she will see:

  An unsurpassed Khojem's Great Newbie-Wizard Skewer *glowing*.
  
A "look skewer" will display:

This is used to impale wizards who gen big weapons in their areas.
This item is magic.
This weapon uses the skill: two handed polearm.

It is fashioned of iron.
This weapon has Flame Blade.


Another thing you need to consider is the Tinker's ability to improve
a weapon.  From what I have heard, weapons not created from the  virtual
weapons server cannot be improved.  Coding the weapon in the mob's code
can help you with this and reduce the number of files you have to maintain.
So here is the npc code for Hagar:

//  Khojem
//  Monster:  Hagar the Horrible
//  File:     hagar.c

#include <std.h>

inherit MONSTER;

create() {
  object ob;
  int   idx; 
  mixed ench_str; 
  ::create();
    set_name("hagar");
    set_id( ({ "hagar","hagar the horrible", "bruiser" }) );
    set_level(10);
    set_short("hagar the horrible");
    set_long("Hagar has a bad habit of picking his nose and has "+
      "long, bushy armpit air." 
      );
    set("race", "high-man");
    set_gender("male");
    set_body_type("human");
    
    // remember to set_overall_ac, Hagar has no armor!
    set_overall_ac(15);
    
    ob = new("/d/damned/virtual/spear_6.weapon");
    ob -> set("short", "Khojem's Great Newbie-Wizard Skewer");
    ob -> set("long", "This is used to impale wizards who gen "+
            "big weapons in their areas."); 
    ob -> set_wc(28, "impaling");

       // set enchantment - *glow* in short description
    ob -> set_property("enchantment",4);

      // maximum spell stacking for flame blade is 4 
      // see /std/spells/flame_blade.c  
    ob -> set_property("flame blade", 4);

      // wc = (power+2) * stack  so, (6 +2) *2 = 32
    ob -> set_wc(32,"fire");

     // allows enchanter w/ detect magic skill to determine
     // magic and power of magic on LOOK AT SKEWER
    ench_str = ({ ({ "This weapon has %^ORANGE%^Flame Blade%^RESET%^.",
     "detect magic" }) });
    ob -> set_property("extra long",ench_str);

    ob -> set_verb("spear");
    ob -> set_parry_bonus(-10);
    ob -> set_weight(95);
    ob -> set_value(120);
    
    ob -> move(this_object());
    
    command("wield spear in right hand and left hand"); 
}

A "look hagar" will show:

You look over the male high-man.
Hagar has a bad habit of picking his nose and has long, bushy armpit air.
Hagar has no missing limbs.
He is in top shape.
He is carrying:
An unsurpassed Khojem's Great Newbie-Wizard Skewer *glowing* (wielded in
right hand and left hand)


== Khojem 7/5/96

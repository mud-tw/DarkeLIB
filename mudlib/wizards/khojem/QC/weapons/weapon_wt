Weapon examples from the real world.

Blades:
   Current blade wt requirements are either 10-30 pounds (weaponweights) or
   27.5-650 pounds (bal.weapon). This is truly way to heavy for any useful
   real weapon short of a maul. Some real life examples of weapon weights
   (all of these are of typical examples, so variation of course occurs,
    also all examples assume steel, iron or bronze tends to be heavier and
    to break/wear out much more quickly):
      Weapon           Length  Weight    Description
      Broadsword         31"     3.5     typical heavy bladed sword for
                                         penetrating heavy body armor
      Tulwar             39"       3     curved Indian sword
      Rapier             39"       2     Typical thin bladed fencing sword
      Katana             43"       3     Basic japanese sword
      Gladius            24"       2     Roman shortsword, thick broad blade
      Scimitar           35"       3     Persian sword, very curved
      Bastard Sword      39"     4.5     Hand and a half sword, used one
                                         handed or two handed.
      Backsword          24"     1.5     Shortsword with single edge
      Falchion           35"     3.5     Curved broad bladed sword, often
                                         exaggerated in cartoons  :)
   As should be fairly obvious, none of these are even remotely close to 
   weighing 10 pounds (the minimum listed in the docs).
   
Knives:
   Current knife requirements 1-8 (weaponweights), or 15-45 pounds 
   (bal.weapons) As should be extrememly obvious, even Rambo's huge knife
   isn't anywhere close to weighing 8 pounds, at most it would be 1.5, to 
   bring knife weights more in line with reality would require most of them
   weighing less than a pound and a particularly large one weighing maybe
   as much as 2 pounds. Examples of fighting knives from history:
      Weapon           Length  Weight    Description
      Dirk               10"     0.9     Single edged scottish dagger
      Bodkin             10"     0.9     Small thrusting dagger
      Kukri              19"       1     Weapon of Gurkas of Nepal. Has a
                                         heavy curved blade
      Main Gauche        20"     1.1     Off hand parrying dagger used in
                                         fencing. Often has large hilt to
                                         protect hand.
      Katar              19"     1.1     Indian thrusting dagger
      Panabas            23"     1.5     Curved Moro knife used in executions

Blunts:
   Current blunt requirements: 5-30 pounds (weaponweights), 20-55 pounds
   (bal.weapon). Most fighting axes would qualify as a blunt weapon since
   most of it's killing potential is from it's mass. This catagory would be
   more appropriately named "Mass weapons" as opposed to blunt. It would break
   down further into axes, maces, flails and clubs. Ok, listing of historical
   weapons:
      Weapon           Length  Weight    Description
      Basic Mace         27"     4.5     A typical mace, being a large mass at
                                         the end of a stick, often with flanges
                                         or spikes.
      Holy Water Sprink. 31"       5     Spiked mace with hollowed center to
        aka Morning star                 pour holy water into, has small holes
                                         to allow the water to come out with
                                         each swing.
      Ball and Chain     35"       5     Typical flail, length includes chain.
                                         Hits harder than a mace because of the
                                         extra speed having the chain allows.
      Battle Axe         31"     4.6     Average Battle axe
      Bearded War Axe    23"     3.3     Fighting axe used by Danes and Vikings
      Mattina            27"       3     Wooden club fitted with sharks teeth
      War Club           55"      10     Huge war club from Fiji
      Maul               43"       9     Sledgehammer with large wooden head.
      
   Both the Maul and the War club require two hands to effectively use, but
   the two handed catagory covers too many different weapon types already.
   
Projectiles:
   Currently: 5-25 pounds (weaponweights), 20-60 pounds (bal.weapon). This 
   weapon catagory covers a fairly broad spectrum of weapon types, boiling down
   to basically, thrown (spears, knives, axes, etc.), Bows (longbow, composite
   bow, short bow, recurve bow, etc.) and Crossbows. The weights for crossbows
   are not entirely out of line, but for anything else it would be too much.
   Examples:
      Weapon           Length  Weight    Description
      Long Bow           70"       2     Standard English long bow
      Tukish Bow         39"       2     
      Apache Bow         39"     1.5     
      Spear              78"       5     Typical fighting spear
      Siege Arbalest     39"      18     Large cross bow requires windlass to
                                         re arm.
      Medium Arbalest    27"     8.5     Smaller crossbow, Goats foot to load
      Light Arbalest     27"     8.5     Even smaller crossbow, can be loaded
                                         without extra equipment, stick foot
                                         in strap at front of bow.
      
   The main difference in crossbows is the pull of the weapon, weight does not
   have too much effect on that unless you move to siege type weapons. Also,
   crossbows have a very low rate of fire, often only about 3 shots a minute
   
Two handed:
   Current requirements: 15-50 pounds(weaponweights), 30-80 pounds (bal.weapon)
   This catagory covers a very wide range of weapons and fighting styles, few
   of which are really similar. Polearms, Greatswords, and Staves all fall into
   this group.  Examples:
      Weapon           Length  Weight    Description
      Poleaxe            82"     6.5     Broad axe head attached to long pole
      Voulge             82"       6     Broad axe blade topped with spike
      Military Fork      82"       5     Two pronged fork polearm
      Halberd            86"       6     Axe blade with point opposing it
      Claymore           47"       6     Scottish great sword
      Flamberge          51"     7.5     Great sword with wavy blade
      Zweihander         78"      14     Large german greatsword with long
                                         straight quillions
      Quarterstaff       70"     3.3     Typical fighting staff
      Pike              214"      14     Long polearm used for defense against
                                         cavalry. Only used in large formations
                                         instead of in single combat

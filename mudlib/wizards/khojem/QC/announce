Mikus asked Duridian and myself to relieve some of the administrative
load from Mikus and Drizzt by assuming the role of area approval.  We
decided to expand this by including a quality control slice to the 
entire thing.  We hope that you will support us in this role and provide
input and communication to make our task easier and more effective.

I have installed a QC board near the LPC, project, and damned board
locations.  I'd like you to use this as a place to openly discuss issues
concerning area balance and overall mud balance.  

For your reading enjoyment I created a sub-directory under /open titled
"QC".  Included are outlines and examples of items required for area
submission.  Also, are several files that examine armours/weapons.
We plan expanding this in the future, so check back occasionally.

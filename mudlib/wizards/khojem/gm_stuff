Hi Khojem,

The chaotic-lord gm weapon is now ready.  The file is
/wizards/nevin/chemoch.c.  The other files are listed at the
top of the chemoch.c file.  I will leave the power high
and the breeding pit rate at one/5 seconds so you can see
what it does for yourself.  I don't want you send you all
the gm weapons at once--unless you wish otherwise, I will
send you a note each time I finish one.  Basically, each
of the gm weapons will have similar wc ratings and three
special powers appropriate to the guild.

Hey khojem here is my suggestion for My GM weapon, The Backbiter,  The GM
sword of the Nightblades.
I feel that the sword should increase back stab and assination still
but it should also have Tw on it.  It is supposed to be a master sword
and it should be far and away better than the rest.  It should also 
be at least +10 on accuracy and maybe have a mag damage rune.  The GM
swords should be better than any sword you can buy or make.  Thus 
it would make it good to be GM.  Maybe an added bonus it the sword
casts Power word stun at its targets and maybe Power word blind.  
One big suggestion is that Only Nightblades may wield this sword.  
It is supposed to be a special magical sword and other guilds that
do not have the same power of the Nightblades should be tremendously 
penialized for wielding it.  Thanks for the intrest in our swords.

Hiya, you asked me to mai you ideas, so here they come...=)  Ok, first I
feel that GM weapons should be useful, not mere dead-weight that symbolize
office. I also feel that GM weapons should be one of those few and rare
weapons that can be made SICK. 
I mean if I can get a better weapon made than my GM weapon, than it merely
becomes extra weight on an already tight carrying strength.  I also feel
that GM weapon should be able to hold permanent enchants, so that if they
can't beat a custom made weapon by
itself, then at least it can be made to do so.  Heh, just some ideas.  Also
for Kalos and I, we'll prolly end up with holy crits on our weapons, do you
think you could replace the summon crits with something else?  I mean there
is no point in using the
weapon when all you do is summon pets to kill for you and take all your
exp.  THe summon crits almost make it a negative xp use weapon.  
Ok, those were my ideas in general.  I have some ideas for the Cleric GM
weapon in particular.  I'll mail them to you later, prolly after I get your
response to this one.  Also I have a question...what is the name of the
Cleric GM weapon?
I think the weapons skills should fit the weapon's name.  So I would be
curious as to its name...thanks alot for being cool, and willing to work on
something thats long overdue.  Heh, you guys sure stay busy don't you? =)~

Here's my take on the GM items... right now they are 
'worse than useless' to me. Here is why:
   Together they take up about 40% of my total carrying 
capacity and the breastplate is mediocre armour and the
avenger is only good for player killing.
   If there were some way that I could summon and dismiss
them it would be different.
   The problem with the avenger is that it 
does holy crits (which it should after all).
However I cannot afford to use anything that does 
holy crits if I want to make any exps cause the summoned
angels take it all away even when they contribute very little
to the success of the fight.
   (This means that holy blade, holy aura, the
holy avenger are all essentially player-kill-only
which is a little backwards for a paladin IMHO).
   Effectiveness-wise, the avenger is _almost_ as 
good as a pretty decent tinked weapon
Not sure where they need to be balance-wise.... that is
up to you guys. The Gm items are way cool, it would
just be nice if they were useful. (Some 
GMs seem to use their weapons all the time, I, however
cannot use it much at all for the above reason.)

Kalos 
ps- the breastplate can be worn along with a
standard breastplate... I am certain this is 
not intended but it is such mediocre armour that
it is not really unbalancing.

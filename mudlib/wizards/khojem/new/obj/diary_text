Activity log of Raol de'Acruut, 
Captain, First Nomadic Irregulars


Biggus 2, Darkeday: Our troop, accompanied by Chief Moped,
Wizard Elder Khojem, and the tribe, arrive after a two day
march from Sangor to an oasis in the Wastelands of
Bir'Barrutt.  Khojem advised Chief Moped to make camp here. 
Naturally, that lizard of a chief followed his advise!

Biggus 3, Grayday:
Wizard Elder Khojem, that spawn of a one-humped camel!, 
conjured up a feast for the entire tribe, had his way with
the best of Chief Moped's harem, and left camp after a late 
morning council with the chief.  Camp is established, water 
supply is fair, the chief's guards are posted around the
camp, and I have sent scouts into the wastelands to ward 
off approachers.

Biggus 4, Stoneday:
Camp is well established now.  On Chief Moped's orders,
I dispatched a war-party to reconnoiter the nearby well
and report on its feasibility as a permanent water supply.
It seems the chief wishes to establish a permanent camp here.
Scouts report back late today of a wandering lone high-man
warrior, Nutnux, searching the wastelands for a sash of some 
sort.  He was reported as non-hostile if not provoked and a 
satanic fighter when attacked.  The scout, Azed, reported a 
magical, sleeping sand creature who when woken killed three 
of the four-man scout team in combat.  Azed, the survivor 
was badly wounded.  I ordered all scouts to avoid the area 
to the south.  When the war-party returns I will order them
to return me the head of this sand creature!


Biggus 5, Skullday:
The scout, Azed, now healed from his wounds by the tribal
cleric, departed the camp as a berserk,mad man.  The guards
reported he swore death an all those traveling the wastelands.
Since he is unwed, I decided not to send out warriors for his
return.  The war-party sent to reconnoiter the well has not 
reported.  I dispatched a team of scouts to investigate.

Biggus 5, Skullday(addendum):
I was awakened to hear an urget report from the survivors 
of the scouts investigating the where-abouts of our missing
war-party.  They reported the war-party was destroyed by a 
hideous foe.  Their slain bodies were seen spiked and trussed 
to the walls within the well!  Their bodies mutilated and 
striped naked!  I called an urgent council with Chief Moped.
He conveyed that Wizard Elder Khojem had suspected a great, 
evil force layed in waiting within the well.  Chief Moped 
instructed me to prepare my warriors for battle at morning's
first light.

Biggus 6, Blackday: 
Chief Moped has ordered the First Nomadic Irregulars to
attack the creatures of the well.  His personal guard and I
were ordered to remain and defend the encampment.  I suspect
the chief is a coward.  I want to personally lead my men in
battle, but I am forced to give control to my subordinate.
I instructed Corporal Agarn to guardedly approach the enemy. 
Corporal Agarn lacks the experience that I have in battle 
and command.  I worry he may lead my force into disaster.
Chief Moped will not listen to my concerns.  The First
Nomadic Irregulars, lead by Corporal Agarn, departed camp
at first light.
